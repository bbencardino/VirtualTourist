This project is an exercise from the Udacity's iOS Nanodegree. The project requires to persist a complex model using Core Data, and plist persistence of an array of dictionaries - core skills required of any iOS Developer.




## What is it?

The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.
